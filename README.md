# KubeCon-2025-Two-Security-Maintainers-Walk-into-a-Cluster
Examples and guides shared in the KubeCon 2025 talk titled "No Joke: Two Security Maintainers Walk into a Cluster". The talk focuses on reviewing common Kubernetes security pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide practical examples and best practices for securing Kubernetes clusters, as discussed in the KubeCon 2025 session. This repository includes code samples, configuration files, and documentation to help users implement security measures in their own clusters. It is meant as a reference for those interested in refreshing their knowledge on fundamentals of Kubernetes cluster configuration security or for those new to the ecosystem.

As maintainers for CNCF ecosystem projects like [Istio](https://istio.io/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), we have seen a wide range of security issues in real-world deployments. This repository aims to share our insights and experiences to help the community build more secure Kubernetes environments.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the content and keep it up-to-date with the latest security practices.
